!! General
    imin = 1,  ! Minimization
    ntmin = 1,  ! Minimization Kind: Steepest descent, then conjugate gradient
    ncyc = 200,  ! Steepest descent interval before starting CG [steps]
    maxcyc = 2000,  ! Total minimization steps [steps]
    drms = 0.0001, ! Convergence criteria for min (RMS total force) [kcal/mol/ang]
    dx0 = 0.01,  ! Size of initial min. step [ang]

!! Output
    iwrap = 0,  ! Do *not* wrap molecules in output
    ntwx = 1,  ! Dump crds interval [tsteps]
    ntpr = 1,  ! Dump logs interval [tsteps]
    ioutfm = 1,  ! Dump crds and logs as netCDF3 (=1)
    ntxo = 2,  ! Dump restart as netCDF3 (=2)

!! Implicit Solvent, Cutoff, PBC
    igb = 0,  ! Explicit solvent, PBC is ON
    cut = 8.0,  ! Non-bonded interactions cutoff [ang]
